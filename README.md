## Over View:
	We intend at prototyping an user-interactive database that helps multiple users to store, modify and go through their transaction history in an organised and time-effective way.

## Functionaities:
	The database enables multiple users to operate on their data through a simple and effective login basis. It further provides users the options to enter, modify, delete and view their data in a process of simple steps.
	The data is stored and managed using files for every user that logs into the system.The final modifications are saved back for future use.

## Conclusion:
	Our small-scale and simple database provides an inexpensive and resourceful way of managing our day-to-day expenses, may it be online or cash transactions. We are looking forward to enhance this for real-time use in future.
